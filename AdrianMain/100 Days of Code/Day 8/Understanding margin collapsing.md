the larger margin wins so to say
margin collapsing only occurs for vertical margins
we dont have this issue for horizontal margins
only happens for block elements

for inline elements we cannot apply vertical margins and for inline block elements

So elements with display inline block rule applied, margin collapsing, simply isnt an issue.

It happens between adjacent elements, it only affects vertical margins,and therefore, it kind of simply defines that the bigger margine defined between two following elements wins, in such cases when it comes to defining the distance the margin between these two elements

The browser collapses two adjacent margines into one (bigger one) - this is default behavior called ****"margin collapsing"
