- The Next Action Habit
Don't focus on whole projects, just the next small actions you need to take
- Reduce the Barrier to start
Start with the smallest action possible even just a couple minutes in the beginning
- Eat the Frog
Do the task you're procrastinating on before anything else, don't move on until it's done
- Set a Timer
This seems simple but it's so powerful, it sets a firm intention to begin working
- Commit to a Deadline
Nothing makes shit happen like a deadline, set one yourself or get a friend to help you.
